## Project 3 Readme

1. I would like to do one of my favorite quotes from the book The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.
2. I will use a movie quote site to get the quote itself. The quote goes as follows:
For what it's worth: it's never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There's no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you're proud of. If you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again.‚Äù
3. I just picked colors that I thought were asthetically pleasing to me and easy for myself to utilize. this project was a struggle for me so I tried to make it as simplistic as possible.
