      <h1> What is responsive web design? </h1>
  <p>
        Responsive web design utilizes HTML and CSS elements allowing the developer to create one site that renders well and is useable on any device of any size. So a site that can be used on a computer can also be seen and used on a smart phone or other device.

      <h1> Why are wireframes important in RWD? </h1>

        <p>

          <strong>Wireframes</strong> are important in web design and more specifically RWD for a number of reasons. Wireframes are essentially just simple layouts that outline how your page and its elements will be set up. Wireframes save time and money by creating a simple visual that is much easier to design compared to making changes on your actual mock up. Utilizing wireframes streamlines the whole process, and allows you to work more efficiently.  </br>

            <p class = "lastboxdescription">Flexboxes allow the web developer an easy way of making the content on their page easily resize. This is very useful for RWD because it ensures that the content on your webpage will fit onto the screen of whatever device is being used. </p></div>
